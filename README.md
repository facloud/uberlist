# Uberlist

I found scheduling tasks during my day very hard. Especially when the nature of
the tasks that I will go through in a day contains chores, administrative
stuff, work related task, side projects and so on. I have been struggling to
find a pattern that helps me go through my day. Failing to do so I decided to
take a step back and try to think. What do I actually need? Why is this so
hard?

I am convinced that answering these questions will only lead to more questions.
What should I use to achieve these goals? What are the adjustments I need to
make to my everyday life to be successful? Uberlist aims to address the problem
of scheduling various types tasks and projects within short time slots of the
userâ€™s day.
